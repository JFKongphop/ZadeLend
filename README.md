# ZadeLend: Cross-Chain Asset Collateralized Loan with ZK Withdrawal

ZadeLend is a cross-chain, privacy-preserving lending protocol where users deposit NFTs on Ethereum L1 and privately withdraw stablecoin loans on L2. Using zero-knowledge proofs and Chainlink CCIP, the system ensures unlinkable deposits and withdrawals with verifiable execution. Users earn stablecoins instantly upon NFT deposit, then later withdraw loans without revealing which asset they used. All actions are trustless and private â€” loan amounts are public, but user identities and asset details remain hidden.

## Key Features

- Privacy-preserving loan withdrawals: Only the proof is public, not which NFT was deposited.
- Cross-chain communication: Uses Chainlink CCIP for secure message passing.
- Double-spend prevention: The nullifiers mapping prevents reusing proofs.
- Time-locked collateral: NFT is locked on the origin chain for a fixed period.
- Reward-based incentive: Users are rewarded with USDC on deposit to encourage participation.

## Smart Contract Responsibilities

### NFTDepositor (Chain A)
- Stores and locks NFTs.
- Emits NFTDeposit events.
- Sends commitments cross-chain via Chainlink CCIP.
- Manages LINK fee balances.
- Allows user to payback USDC to unlock their NFT.

### Withdraw (Chain B)
- Maintains a Merkle Tree of commitments.
- Receives and logs commitments via _ccipReceive().
- Validates ZK withdrawal via loanWithdraw():
- Ensures the proof is valid.
- Checks nullifier not used.
- Transfers loanAmount in USDC to the user.

## Overview of the flow

### Step 1: Deposit NFT on Chain A (e.g., L1)

#### User

- Approves the contract to transfer their NFT.
- Generates a commitment using their secret and loan amount.
- Sends the commitment along with their NFT.

#### Contract

- Locks the NFT.
- Sends the commitment to Chain B via Chainlink CCIP.
- Mints a reward of 100 USDC to the user as a "deposit reward."

### Step 2: On Chain B (e.g., L2 or Privacy Layer)

#### Contract

- Receives the commitment via CCIP.
- Inserts it into a Merkle Tree (_insert()).
- Emits LeafCommitment(commitment, leafIndex).

### Step 3: User Withdraws Loan Anonymously

#### User
- Generates a ZK proof off-chain proving:
- Their commitment exists in the Merkle Tree.
- Their nullifier is unique.
- They are entitled to the specific loanAmount.
- Submits the ZK proof, root, public nullifier, and public loanAmount.

#### The contract:
- Validates the proof via the IVerifier contract.
- Ensures the nullifier hasn't been used.
- Transfers loanAmount USDC to the user.
